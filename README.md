# SoC-Physical-design-using-Sky130
 A 5-day lab-based hands-on workshop that gives knowledge of hierarchical physical design flow on how to build a chip from scratch using multiple opensource tools. This workshop also gives an understanding of all the steps in RTL to GDSII flow in detail.


OpenLANE (An open source automated flow) - 

OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several tools including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for designing and optimization.

Here's a picture of the OpenLANE flow diagram :
